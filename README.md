pickmail
========

grab a single piece of mail off of your imap server, write it to a file

## motivation
1. I'm not setting up fetchmail or some other nonsense to copy all my mail to my servers just to get one file and one attachment
2. I'm not hardcore enough to really bother with mutt or some other super heavy-hitting mail client to pick up an attachment on gmail
